## Real-time application where you can vote and add your favorites bands

For this app, I use Socket.io library in an express application and React.js for the client side,
The class-oriented server approach for greater scalability. And React App is modularized and ready for multiples uses, thanks to implementation of Custom Hooks and Context Provider to obteins the Socket connection.
